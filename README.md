# hello-world
Test repository to get the hang of github

This is the README file.
History:
This file was created small, then branched to add some lines referring to the branch.
Than the branch was deleted.

Status:
Since referring to a non-existing branch does not make sence, those parts got removed.

Warning:
After clicking on the project, the master branch is shown by default. Got to watch carefully!

At the time of creating a pull request, I forgot to compare the file. Doing that well in this branch :)
